## Hey, I’m Tylor.

I’m building a hands-on cybersecurity portfolio focused on **Active Directory**, **homelabs**, and **automation**.

This site documents what I’m building, breaking, and learning along the way.

### What you’ll find here
- Active Directory labs (Windows Server, GPOs, user management)
- Blue team fundamentals (logging, event review, detection basics)
- Red team simulations (controlled lab environments)
- Automation projects (PowerShell + Python)

### Start here
