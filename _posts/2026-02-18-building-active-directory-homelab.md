## Introduction

In this lab, I set up an Active Directory Domain Controller using Windows Server 2019 and connected a Windows 10 client to simulate a real-world enterprise environment.

This homelab allows me to practice:

- Domain configuration
- Group Policy
- User management
- Attack simulations
- Blue team logging & monitoring

## Network Overview

- Windows Server (Domain Controller)
- Windows 10 Client
- Internal NAT network
- Static IP for DC
- DNS pointed to DC

More screenshots and attack scenarios coming soon.
