## Why I Made This Blog

I got tired of just watching tutorials thinking I was learning.

For a while, I was doing what most people do: watching videos, following walkthroughs, reading guides. I was learning, but it didn’t feel real. I wasn’t breaking anything. I wasn’t troubleshooting. I wasn’t building from scratch.

So I decided to stop consuming and start building.

I wanted a place where I could document my process. I’m not going for perfectly polished write-ups. These are real labs with real troubleshooting and real progress.

## What I’m Building

Instead of spinning up random tools and calling it experience, I built my own environment.

I needed hands-on experience with Active Directory and Group Policy, so that’s why I started my AD homelab.

There are many more labs to come, stick around to see how far it goes.

  - Windows Server domain controller

  - Windows client machines

  - Automated user creation with PowerShell

  - Logging and event analysis

  - Digital forensics tooling

  - Network segmentation inside virtual machines

When something breaks, I fix it.

When I don’t understand something, I dig into it.

When I recover deleted data or analyze raw hex, I write about it.

Everything here is hands-on.

## What You’ll Find Here

This blog documents my current labs and many more to come:

  - Active Directory lab build

  - Digital forensics case studies

  - NTFS and disk artifact analysis

  - Hash comparisons and file carving

  - Lessons learned while troubleshooting real configurations

If it’s posted here, it was built, tested, or analyzed by me.

## Why It Matters

Technical skills are easy to list on a resume but when the questions get asked, it's better to actually be prepared.

This lab gives me a controlled environment to practice cybersecurity the way it actually works; with real systems, real logs, real user accounts, and real mistakes.

My goal isn’t just to complete as many labs as I can. It is to understand systems deeply enough to break them, analyze them, and rebuild them. This is what interests me most, the inner and outer workings of how, why and what.

This site is where I document what I build.
